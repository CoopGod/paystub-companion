# Paystub Companion
***Inspiration***
The other day my paycheck was sent in with my taxes charged much higher than they were supposed to be. So, I thought that there should be an easily accessible system allowing for fewer errors and easier organization.

***What it does***
A website that allows for updating and organizing of employee earnings, with a system to allow for quickly sending/printing paystubs

***Languages***
Using python with Flask for the backend, HTML+CSS for the frontend, and SQL for the database
