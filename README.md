# Paystub Companion
## Inspiration
The other day my paycheck was sent in with my taxes charged much higher than they were supposed to be. I thought that there should be an easily accessible system allowing for fewer errors.
## What it does
A website that allows for easy updating and organizing of employee earnings, with an excellent system to allow for quickly sending/printing paystubs
## How we built it
Using python with Flask for the backend, HTML+CSS for the frontend, and SQL for the database
